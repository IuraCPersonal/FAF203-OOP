#### TODO:

- ~~Create a program, where you should instantiate 3 objects of Box type (which should have the following instance variables -> height, width and depth), via its constructor in 3 different ways:~~
- Create a class Queue and instantiate 2 objects of this type. Each queue should have as state the number of elements from it and can be created via constructors with and without parameter. If it is created with parameter, then it should have that parameter value maximum size, otherwise it should not have that limitation.
- ~~Implement two methods for surface area and volume calculation of a box and use it on a box created with 3 different instance variables. Print the results in console.~~
- In class Queue add a method for that checks if the object is empty and one that checks if the object is full (in case queue has no parameters, it should say it is never full, otherwise it should check the number of elements compared to the queue size). Also use these methods in a program and print the results in console.
