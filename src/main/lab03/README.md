## OOP Laboratory Work 03

#### TODO:

- Create a program where you should have a huge text (hardcoded in a variable) and it should prompt in console the number of sentences and words of this text.
- You should have, at least, one class for the main function and another class for the text manipulation info.
- Show in the console the number of letters, vowels and consonants from that text.
- Implement also to show the most often words in the text (top 5) and the longest one.
