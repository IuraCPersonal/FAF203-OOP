## OOP Laboratory Work 03

#### TODO:

- ~~Create a program where you should have a huge text (hardcoded in a variable) and it should prompt in console the number of sentences and words of this text.~~
- ~~You should have, at least, one class for the main function and another class for the text manipulation info.~~
- ~~Show in the console the number of letters, vowels and consonants from that text.~~
- ~~Implement also to show the most often words in the text (top 5) and the longest one.~~

#### IN:

```
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
```

#### OUT:
